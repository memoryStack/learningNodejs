express router is used to breakdown all the API endpoints handlers
in multiple files based on the API groupings

ex -> here "/api/people" endpoints handle people related CRUD operations
and "/login" handlers authentication related logic. so 
by using express router we can breakdown these endpoints in separate folders
and manage our requests better
